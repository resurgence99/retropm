              The day started with the whistle of the train, puffing briskly
              towards the rain prone woods. The shadow casted by the sky
              towering trees was enough to cover the entire forest floor with
              its enchanting fear. In my opinion, it was nearly impossible for
              anyone to know the presence of any settlements from a distance.
              The mystical atmosphere was enough to put even a gloomy man to
              complete enthusiasm in just a sight. The trees for over hundred
              years had instilled fear among the young. It was in this dense
              precipitous forest a young vibrant and valor soldier was born.
